We compare the obtained estimates of $\ln g(E)$ for systems A (1D) and B (2D),
see Fig~\ref{fig:compar}, for the last five iterations in $f$ for each to
evaluate the convergence. From the figure we find that the estimates
have converged in both systems.

Wang-Landau estimation of $\ln g(E)$ for systems A (left) and B (right),

\section{Heat capacity}
Using the converged estimates for both systems we estimate the respective
heat capacities. Note that due to considerations of unphysical cyclical
aggregates we omit temperatures where the probabilities $P_T(E=-699)$ or
$P_T(E=-698)$ are above the threshold $10^{-4}$. The heat capacities
are provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:heat}. The heat capacity is maximised at the
points $T_A = 0.650$ for system A and $T_B= 0.657$ for B.

\section{Probability distribution}
Finally, we construct the probability distribution functions (PDFs) for the
systems at the temperatures that maximises the respective heat capacities.
The data is smoothed in bins of width 4, see Fig~\ref{fig:pdf}.
For a system with an abrupt transition between the disordered solution
and the mixed state one expects a bimodal energy distribution. According
to the obtained PDFs system A is unimodal while B is bimodal.
